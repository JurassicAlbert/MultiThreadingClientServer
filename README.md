### MultiThread ATM Application

The sole purpose of creating this project was to fulfill a requirement for my bachelor's degree studies.<br>
Although there are functionalities and logic that could be written more efficiently, the advantage I gained from this project is the increased confidence in multitasking while maintaining necessary requirements and essential features.<br>
I managed to develop the code within a short timeframe, all while attending other labs, learning, and coding for cloud infrastructure simultaneously.<br>

___
Customers using the Customer Terminal (TK) can perform one of the following operations:

*make a transfer to another account (if sufficient funds are available and the target account number exists),

*withdraw funds (if available),

*make a deposit (simply increases the balance),

*check the account balance (i.e., read the balance).

___
A project was developed to showcase the communication between a banking system and a customer terminal in Python 3.10.
For the purposes of the project, a server application was prepared, capable of handling multiple threads.
Additionally, a client application was created to facilitate communication with the server on a specific thread.
The server can concurrently work with multiple client applications running at the same time.
